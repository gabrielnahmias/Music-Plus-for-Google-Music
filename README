Music Plus adds controls, notifications, Last.fm support, global keyboard shortcuts, and lyrics to Google Play Music.

Note: You need to have a Google Play Music account to use this extension. Currently Google Play Music is in beta and only available in the United States. If you're not seeing an enabled feature in your Google Play Music tab, try refreshing your Google Play Music tab.

Features (most can be enabled or disabled in the extension options):

- Adds artist and album bios to Google Play Music from Last.fm
- Scrobbles tracks to Last.fm (by Daniel Slaughter http://www.danielslaughter.com/projects/google-music-with-lastfm/)
- Fetch lyrics for the currently playing track (by Chris Hendry http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/105238)
- Shows notifications when tracks change
- Lets you control or navigate your library from a popup
- Adds global keyboard shortcuts for controlling playback (see the extension options for details). Chrome extensions don't have a lot of options for universal keyboard shortcuts, so shortcuts won't always work work on all pages, but they work fairly well.

The extension does not collect any information, but requires access to your other tabs and browser history for functionality. 

This extension is made from a combination of scripts I wrote and userscripts written by others. If you'd like to help out by contributing a new feature or fixing bugs, you can fork the source on GitHub:
